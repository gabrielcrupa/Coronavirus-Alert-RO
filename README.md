Coronavirus Alert RO was made for the "West University Of Timisoara", for the discipline "Web Technologies".
_______________________________________________________

THE BATCH SERVERS DO NOT WORK ANYMORE, since I closed the Google Maps API billing account.

Just access the program through the main html.

Ignore what's written bellow, if you aren't going to use your own Google Maps API key.

Also DISABLE ADBLOCK. Otherwise the alerts won't work.
_______________________________________________________

You need to have any Python 3.x.x version installed.

After that, just run one of the batch files. If one doesn't work, the other one should.

To close the server, you need to go to the cmd and press "CTRL + C", "y" and "Enter".
